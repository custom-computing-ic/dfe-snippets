# Multi-Channel LMem design

This is a simple pass-through kernel built to test the multiple memory
channel feature in MaxCompiler 2015.2

##Notes
1. You can vary the number of kernes and memory channels by setting
the **n_kernel** parameter in the manager. This value must be in the
range [1, 6]
2. This design works on Maia, but not for max3 (possible bug in API)
3. Any questions please email me (jma11_at_ic.ac.uk)
